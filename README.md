# RESTful API Exercise
## Using the IPD Database API to display allele data

### Getting started
I made a git repo to keep things organized and created all the necessary files for creating the webpage.

Tested the API in Thunder Client, success

Linked HTML, CSS, and JS files together

Created basic HTML structure for DOM manipulation

Created JS variables from HTML elements

Wrote fetch request flow, converted data to json, evaluated structure of data, error catching

Created variable to hold all data

For loop loops through all data array and creates a new HTML element for each allele accession/name pair

Conditional logic if/else decides which parent div to append the new child to, based on isotype
